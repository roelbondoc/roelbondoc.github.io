Find out what I'm up to!

## Work

I'm currently looking for my next opportunity!

## Fun

On the side, I'm hacking away at my side project. It's called
[Discode](https://rubyup.dev/discode). Discode helps you turn a Rails app into
something you can sell and ship with a single command. I even use it to sell
Discode itself.

I've been enjoying cycling and breadmaking during my free time.

I also enjoy playing competitive videos games, especially
[Heroes of the Storm](https://heroesofthestorm.blizzard.com/en-us/). Hit me up
if you ever want to play!

## Family

My wife and I have 3 kids, ages 11, 8, and 3. Time has just been flying
by so fast, so I've been trying to be more mindful of the moment and enjoy
every second I have with them.
