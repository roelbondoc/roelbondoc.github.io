## Work

I'm a software developer working at [Honeybadger](https://www.honeybadger.io).
This has probably been the smallest company I've worked for with a 5 person
headcount. Even though we are small, I'm amazed every day with how much we can
accomplish.

## Fun

On the side, I'm hacking away at my side project. Right now it's a personal
email application. I'm hoping to open source it soon, but I use it every day as
my daily driver for email.

I've also recently taken an interest in road cycling. In 2023 I put in the most
mileage I've ever had on my bike. This year I'm hoping to break that record and
join more cycling events.

I also still enjoy playing competitive videos games, especially
[Heroes of the Storm](https://heroesofthestorm.blizzard.com/en-us/). Hit me up
if you ever want to play!

## Family

My wife and I have 3 kids, ages nine, six, and two. Time has just been flying
by so fast, so I've been trying to be more mindful of the moment and enjoy
every second I have with them.
